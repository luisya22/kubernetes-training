        "title": "What is a Pod?",
        "content": "A Pod encapsulates one or more containers, storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the containers should run.\n\nPods are defined using YAML files. Here's how to create one:",

            "explanation": "The declarative approach (YAML files) is preferred because you can version control your configurations. The imperative approach is faster for quick tests."
